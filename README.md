# Cobrowse.io - React Native SDK

Cobrowse.io is 100% free and easy to try out in your own apps. Please see full documentation at [https://docs.cobrowse.io](https://docs.cobrowse.io).

Try our **online demo** at the bottom of our homepage at <https://cobrowse.io/#tryit>.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save cobrowse-sdk-react-native

CobrowseIO.license = "put your license key here";
CobrowseIO.start();

```
